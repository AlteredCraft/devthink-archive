Greetings, fellow software developers! We've packed this week's newsletter with a treasure trove of content that is sure to captivate your interest. From tutorials on leveraging large language models and Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques, to the latest open-source tools and AI coding assistants, this edition is brimming with insights and practical advice to help you stay ahead of the curve. I'm especially excited to share the news on Nvidia's cutting-edge AI chatbot and AMD's new AI chips. Dive in and let's explore the future of generative AI together!



## ðŸ“–Â **TUTORIALS & CASE STUDIES**

### **Training Python Code with an LLM**

Read time: 7 minutes



This article describes a novel approach to using a LLMsÂ toÂ [automatically generate a Python script]("https://github.com/run-llama/gmail-extractor")Â for categorizing emails and extracting travel destinations from flight itineraries.Â The author demonstrates how the LLMÂ can progressively improve the detection function by training it on a subset of emails,Â rather than running the LLM onÂ every email.Â This optimized approach saves on token usage and costs.Â The author also discusses plans to further improveÂ the system,Â such as using a local model and refining the email search to focus on actualÂ itineraries.
