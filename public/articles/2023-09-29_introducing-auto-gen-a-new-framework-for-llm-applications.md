## 🧰 **TOOLS**

**Introducing AutoGen: A New Framework for LLM Applications**  
read time: 8 minutes



Microsoft, Penn State University, and University of Washington have collaborated to create [AutoGen]("https://github.com/microsoft/autogen"), a framework for developing Large Language Model (LLM) applications. AutoGen simplifies the orchestration of complex LLM workflows, supports diverse conversation patterns, and provides an enhanced inference API. It also allows for easy performance tuning and advanced usage patterns.

**Augmenting Large Language Models with Code Execution**  
read time: 10 minutes  
Replit has developed two prototypes to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with code execution capabilities. The [first]("https://replit.com/@luisreplit/eval-python") is a stateless container server for simple math evaluations, while the [second](https://blog.replit.com/ai-agents-code-execution"https://blog.replit.com/ai-agents-code-execution") is a more stateful environment for complex workflows. These tools aim to overcome LLMs' limitations and unlock new use cases, such as coding assistants and problem-solving algorithms.

**Magentic: Streamlined Integration of Large Language Models into Python**  
read time: 10 minutes  
Magentic is a Python library that simplifies the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into your code. It offers features like atomic prompts, compatibility with normal functions, and type annotations. It also supports streaming of LLM outputs and asynchronous querying for increased speed. Learn more about it [here]("https://github.com/jackmpcollins/magentic").

**Introducing Mistral Transformer: A 7B Model for AI Developers**  
read time: 5 minutes  
Mistral AI has released a 7B model, [Mistral Transformer]("https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src"), with minimal code for easy implementation. The model uses sliding window attention to speed up inference and reduce memory pressure. It also features a rolling buffer cache and pre-fill and chunking for efficient sequence generation. The model is available for download and can be run with custom prompts.

**LLM Guard: Enhancing Security for Large Language Models**  
read time: 5 minutes  
The Laiyer.ai team has developed [LLM Guard]("https://github.com/laiyer-ai/llm-guard"), a comprehensive tool designed to enhance the security of Large Language Models (LLMs). It offers sanitization, detection of harmful language, prevention of data leakage, and resistance against prompt injection attacks, ensuring safe and secure interactions with LLMs.
