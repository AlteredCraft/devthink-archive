## The prompt



In the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding the prompt is crucial. A great deal of the AI products we see out there are just thin facades over an LLM and a well crafted prompt.

### Tips for effective prompting

**1) Give the model examples of what‚Äôs expected**

Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting can be used to guide an LLM in generating desired outputs for various tasks. In general, it is a good idea to be as precise as possible when building a prompt. This will help to ensure that the language model generates output that is what you were expecting.

0Ô∏è‚É£ **zero-shot** prompt

Prompt:  
*Write a poem about a beautiful and majestic animal.*

This prompt does not give the LLM any examples of animal poems, but it does provide instructions on what kind of poem to write. The LLM can use its knowledge of the world and of animals to generate a poem that meets these instructions.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **one-shot** prompt

Prompt:  
*Here is an example of an animal poem:*

*The lion is king of the jungle, With a mane of golden fur. He is strong and fierce, And his roar can be heard for miles.*

*Write another animal poem that is similar to this one.*

This prompt gives the LLM one example of an animal poem to work from. The LLM can use this example to generate a new poem that is similar in style and content.

üî¢¬†**few-shot** prompt

Prompt:  
*Here are three examples of animal poems:*

- *The lion is king of the jungle, With a mane of golden fur. He is strong and fierce, And his roar can be heard for miles.*
- *The elephant is the largest land animal, With a trunk that can lift up to 6,000 pounds. He is gentle and intelligent, And he is a symbol of wisdom in many cultures.*
- *The penguin is a flightless bird, That lives in the coldest parts of the world. He is playful and social, And he is a symbol of Antarctica.*

*Write an animal poem that is similar to these three poems.*

This prompt gives the LLM three examples of animal poems to work from. The LLM can use these examples to generate a new poem that is similar in style, content, and structure.

**2) Give the Model Time to Think; using ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù**

LLMs will often rush to an answer. For a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and other reasoning tasks, this can result in incorrect answers.

Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning if the topic which speaks to constructing prompts in a manner which encourages the model to slow down and decompose reasoning requests into intermediate steps, and in doing so arrive at a correct answer. Simply adding ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù to the prompt is a common hack to encourages the language model to take on just such behavior.

Here we see Bard trip up on a simple math problem but persevere when adding ‚Äúlet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù (Chat GPT-4 had the same issue and also corrected itself by adding having ‚Äúlet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù added to the prompt)
