### **Essential AI Content for Software Devs,** **Minus the Hype**

Welcome to the latest edition of our AI newsletter, where we bring you the most essential content for software developers, minus the hype. In this issue, we dive into the world of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its potential to revolutionize AI-driven content generation. We also explore the latest tools and techniques for fine-tuning large language models and discuss the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in AI systems. As always, thank you for being a part of our community, and please feel free to [share]("https://devthinkai.beehiiv.com/") this newsletter with your colleagues and friends who are interested in staying up-to-date with the latest developments in AI.

### Fine-tuning Mixtral 8x7B with AutoTrain: A Step-by-Step Guide

read time: 10 minutes



This [blog post]("https://huggingface.co/blog/abhishek/autotrain-mixtral-dgx-cloud-local") provides a detailed guide on how to fine-tune the Mixtral 8x7B model on your own dataset using AutoTrain. It covers the process for both local and cloud-based training, specifically using Hugging Face's DGX Cloud. The post also includes a CLI command for those who prefer it.

### Unlocking the Power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Large Language Models

read time: 20 minutes  
This [article]("https://learnopencv.com/rag-with-llms/") explores the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can overcome these limitations. It provides a comprehensive guide on building a RAG system using LangChain, a user-friendly framework, and demonstrates how to integrate an LLM with the RAG system to enhance its capabilities.

### Running Open-Source Large Language Models Locally with Ollama

read time: 10 minutes  
This [guide]("https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-run-open-source-llms-locally-using-ollama/") provides a walkthrough on how to use Ollama, a tool for interacting with open-source large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA 2 and LLaVA. It covers downloading Ollama, and running text-based and multimodal models locally, offering developers transparency and customization.

### Plandex: An Open Source, Terminal-Based AI Coding Engine

read time: 10 minutes  
Plandex is an [open-source, terminal-based AI coding engine]("https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex") that uses long-running agents to break down and implement complex tasks. It features a protected sandbox for changes review, built-in version control, and efficient context management. It currently relies on the OpenAI API, with support for other models coming soon. Plandex Cloud offers an easy way to use the tool, with free accounts currently available.

### Backtracing: A New Approach to Understanding User Queries

read time: 10 minutes



Researchers introduce a new task, [Backtracing]("https://github.com/rosewang2008/backtracing"), aimed at identifying the text segment that likely prompted a user query. The study includes a benchmark for backtracing and evaluates various retrieval systems. The findings highlight the need for new retrieval approaches, with the ultimate goal of helping content creators refine their work and enhance user experiences.

### Claude's Tool Use: A New Way to Extend AI Capabilities

read time: 15 minutes  
Anthropic's AI model, Claude, now supports interaction with external tools, enhancing its task performance capabilities. The feature is currently in public beta and allows developers to provide custom tools for Claude to use. Learn more about this feature and how to implement it in your applications [here]("https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/tool-use").

### FastLLM: Qdrant's Game-Changing Language Model for RAG Applications

read time: 5 minutes



Qdrant introduces [FastLLM]("https://qdrant.tech/blog/fastllm-announcement/"), a lightweight Language Model optimized for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. With a context window of 1 billion tokens, FastLLM integrates with Qdrant to process vast amounts of data, promising to revolutionize AI-driven content generation at a massive scale.

### Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Improved AI Responses

read time: 3 minutes



ThoughtWorks teams have successfully used Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance the quality of responses from large language models (LLMs). RAG uses relevant documents stored in databases to provide richer context to the LLM, resulting in higher quality output. Read more about this technique [here]("https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/summary/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag").

### Unveiling Many-Shot Jailbreaking: A New Vulnerability in Large Language Models

read time: 15 minutes



Researchers at [Anthropic]("https://www.anthropic.com/research/many-shot-jailbreaking") have discovered a new vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs) called 'many-shot jailbreaking'. This technique can force LLMs to produce potentially harmful responses by exploiting the longer context window. The team has already implemented mitigations and is actively working on others, emphasizing the importance of addressing such vulnerabilities as AI models become more powerful.
