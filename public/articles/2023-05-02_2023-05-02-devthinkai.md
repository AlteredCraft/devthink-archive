Stay informed on the latest tools and trends of AI assisted software development

**Welcome!**

**GitLab Introduces AI-Driven Tool to Simplify Security for Developers**

GitLab has introduced a new AI-powered security feature that explains potential vulnerabilities to developers. They plan to expand the feature to automatically resolve vulnerabilities in the future. It uses a LLM to combine basic information about vulnerabilities with insights from the user's code. The context-sensitive approach aims to make it easier and faster for teams to remediate issues. The goal of the AI initiative is to increase efficiency across the development lifecycle.

*“If development is 20% of the life cycle, even if we make that 50% more effective, you’re not really going to feel it,” DeSanto said. “Now, if we make the security teams, the operations teams, the compliance teams also more efficient, then as an organization, you’re going to see it.”*

**Be cautious of using "GPT" in your product/project names**

OpenAI is seeking to trademark "GPT" to protect its brand from numerous copycats like ThreatGPT, MedicalGPT, and DateGPT. Their petition to expedite the process was dismissed due to missing fees and documentation. The decision may take up to five months, and even then, the outcome isn't guaranteed. If successful, OpenAI could prevent others from using "GPT" broadly, but it may become expensive to pursue offenders.

**Battle of the AI Coding Assistants: you might be surprised by who is in the lead**

This article compares four AI bots for coding, including GPT-4, Bing, Claude+, and Bard, and tests them on the Leetcode 214 problem. Overall, AI bots for coding are rapidly evolving, and these four bots show promise in generating high-quality code for various programming languages and applications.

**AI: Enhancing the Future of Software Engineering, Not Replacing It**

The article discusses the future of software engineering with the introduction of AI tools such as Copilot and ChatGPT. The author argues that these tools will not replace software developers, but rather enhance their productivity and enable them to create new products. Similar productivity boosts have been seen in the past with the introduction of high-level programming languages, the shift to the cloud, and open-source culture. The author suggests that engineers should embrace these tools, stay up-to-date with new technologies, learn about AI and machine learning, and be involved in the open-source community to prepare for the changing world of software engineering.

*“Think about yourself as a lead/senior engineer working with 5 junior engineers - this will be more like that than “give me an app that does X Y X” and that is it.”*

**Revolutionize Your SQL Workflow with DB Pilot - The AI-Enhanced Database GUI**

DB Pilot is a database GUI enhanced by AI that includes a personal AI-powered assistant to help with SQL queries, explain queries, and convert between code and SQL. It supports popular libraries and can convert code to SQL and vice versa. Additional features include easy filtering, joining data from different file formats, and writing query results to CSV, JSON, or Parquet files. Currently supporting PostgreSQL databases, DB Pilot will add support for MySQL and SQLite in the future.
