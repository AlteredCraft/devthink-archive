AI topics for software developers

*Curating the ocean of AI news keeping you informed on topics key to the craft of software development*



## 🧰 AI tools to help you build software

**Translates Human Language Descriptions into applications**

[AutoCode Pro]("https://autocodepro.com/") is an AI-powered platform that turns ideas into code by parsing prompts and translating them into fully functional applications. Still in the early stages, UI is a bit buggy, but the author admits to as much and they are actively improving it. Currently supports building chrome extensions with web and mobile apps coming next. This could be a great tool for getting the boilerplate of you app built with some minimal functionality which you can then expand upon.

**AskCodi, a comprehensive tool developers can use throughout the development process**

[AskCodi]("https://www.askcodi.com/"), a development tool designed to streamline coding tasks, offers features like Codi Projects for organized code generation, Codi Chat for problem-solving assistance, and Codi Workbook for interactive code generation, explanations, and documentation. I had a few issues with the output of tasks such as documentation, bit I think it is worth keeping track of this project for its concept of projects containing persisted chats and workbooks.

**Codefy.ai is your own toolbox of useful coding widgets to help you speed up your workflow.**



This is an interesting one, instead of an IDE extension, [Codefy.ai]("https://www.codefy.ai/") is a suite of specialized online chat forms for tasks such as Code writing, code explaining, and code optimizer. Select a tool, paste your code in and start your chat.

## 🏗️ Utilizing AI in your software

**NVIDIA ACE for Games Sparks Life into Virtual Characters with Generative AI**

NVIDIA has announced [NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE)]("https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-ace-for-games-sparks-life-into-virtual-characterswith-generative-ai") for Games, a custom AI model foundry service that aims to transform games by bringing intelligence to non-playable characters (NPCs) through AI-powered natural language interactions. I feel this can really improve the immersion of games, hearing that repeated dialog can really distract from gameplay.

**Get your ChatGPT-like interface in minutes**

Need a well crafted ChatGPT like interface for your next Python AI application? [Chainlit]("https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit") has you covered, this is a Python library that helps you create ChatGPT-like UIs on top of any Python code in minutes. Well [documented](https://docs.chainlit.io/examples/openai-sql"https://docs.chainlit.io/examples/openai-sql") with great examples. I plan to test this one soon.

**You can now use Amazon Bedrock from LangChain**

LangChain now has [LLM and embedding model wrappers]("https://twitter.com/LangChainAI/status/1664301150760497154") for Amazon's new Bedrock. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides access to foundational models and the tools to customize them for specific applications. It is designed to make it as easy as possible for developers to build and deploy generative AI applications

## 📰 AI topics for devs

**The Falcon has landed in the Hugging Face ecosystem**



[Falcon-40B]("https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon") is the best open-source large language model available. It outperforms other models on the OpenLLM Leaderboard and is made available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

**Looking for a job in AI?**

[Jobdai is a job search platform]("https://www.jobdai.com/") that uses AI to match job seekers with the best job opportunities. It offers personalized job recommendations, resume optimization, and interview preparation.

**Safeguarding Your Code from Hardcoded Secrets in LLM-Generated Code**

This [SC Magazine article]("https://www.scmagazine.com/perspective/emerging-technology/five-ways-to-prevent-the-risks-from-hardcoding-secrets-in-code-generated-by-llms") reminds us that LLMs can inadvertently generate code with hardcoded secrets, posing a significant security risk. The article provides key strategies to help prevent and mitigate this risk.

**AI is reaching into all aspects of the developer workflow**

Many of us can relate to being on pager duty. [PagerDuty]("https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/generative-ai-for-the-pagerduty-operations-cloud/") has integrated generative AI into its Status Update, leveraging AI to process all data related to the current incident and auto-generate a summary, offering key insights on events, progress, and challenges.

**Google search labs experience**

I received access to Google Search Labs Experience. This is their answer to Microsoft's Bing search. Currently there are 3 modules to activate;



Truthfully, I've not found it overly useful, but to be honest I never found Bing's implementation very useful either. The UI's seem cluttered and not well integrated and for search activities it just got in the way. For research tasks I'd rather just use strait ChatGPT or Bard.



Honestly for an AI integrated search experience, I currently prefer what [perplexity]("https://www.perplexity.ai/") is offering; a less distracting UI which also presents very well on mobile.

## 📚 Read/Listen/Watch : Learn

*Learn while you commute, do chores, exercise…*

**Building Systems with the ChatGPT API** [course: 1hr]

[In this short course from DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI]("https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-systems-with-chatgpt/"), you will learn how to use the ChatGPT API to build complex applications. You will learn how to break down complex tasks into smaller ones, chain multiple calls to the API, and evaluate the output of your application for safety, accuracy, and quality.

**Boost Your AI Career with Google's Free Generative AI Training** [9 courses: 45min each]

[Google Cloud has released a new set of training resources]("https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/training-certifications/new-google-cloud-generative-ai-training-resources") for developers who want to learn about generative AI. The resources include courses, tutorials, and hands-on labs that cover a wide range of topics, from the basics of generative AI to more advanced topics like natural language processing and computer vision. I'm considering joining a course myself. Are you?

**LangChain Crash Course** [watch: 18min]

[Dive into LangChain]("https://youtu.be/5-fc4Tlgmro"), a robust framework for building AI applications using LLMs from OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Google. This is from one of my current favorite AI Youtube channels: Prompt Engineering. They do an excellent job of introducing concepts in a thorough but efficient manner.
