**Introducing Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by LlamaIndex**  
read time: 10 minutes  
LlamaIndex introduces a new paradigm, multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), extending the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle both text and images. This includes support for GPT-4V, a multi-modal model released by OpenAI. The [blog post]("https://blog.llamaindex.ai/multi-modal-rag-621de7525fea") provides a detailed walkthrough of the new abstractions and their potential applications.

**Rust+Wasm: A Powerful Alternative for AI Inference**  
read time: 15 minutes  
The Rust+Wasm stack offers a lightweight, fast, and portable alternative to Python for AI inference applications. A [simple Rust program]("https://www.secondstate.io/articles/fast-llm-inference/") demonstrates running inference on llama2 models at native speed, with the binary application being completely portable across devices with heterogeneous hardware accelerators. The Rust+Wasm stack is touted as the future of AGI by Elon Musk.

**Enhancing Text Summarization with Chain of Density and GPT-3.5 Fine-tuning**  
read time: 20 minutes  
This [article]("https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/blog/2023/11/05/chain-of-density/") demonstrates how to implement the Chain of Density method for AI-based text summarization and fine-tune a GPT-3.5 model to match GPT-4's capabilities. The approach reduces latency by 20x, cuts costs by 50x, and maintains entity density.

**Mastering the Art of Production-Grade LLM Applications**  
read time: 15 minutes  
This [guide]("https://buildingaistuff.com/p/the-developers-guide-to-production") provides developers with advanced techniques for transitioning Large Language Model (LLM) applications from development to production. It covers prompt engineering, evaluations, the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context, and fine-tuning for specialization. The guide also discusses common pitfalls and how to avoid them, ensuring the creation of scalable, stable, and cost-effective LLM applications.
