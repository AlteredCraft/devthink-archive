**Mastering Large Language Models in 2023: A Comprehensive Guide**  
read time: 30 minutes



Louis Bouchard provides a [comprehensive guide]("https://www.louisbouchard.ai/from-zero-to-hero-with-llms/") to mastering Large Language Models (LLMs) in 2023. The guide is designed for those with a basic programming and machine learning background and includes resources for learning, practicing, and staying updated in the field of LLMs.

**Practical Tips for Finetuning Large Language Models with LoRA**  
read time: 15 minutes  
This [article]("https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/practical-tips-for-finetuning-llms") provides practical insights into finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It discusses the consistency of LoRA, trade-offs with QLoRA, the impact of learning rate schedulers, and the comparison between Adam and SGD optimizers. The author also addresses common questions around LoRA and shares lessons from numerous experiments.

**Building Custom Chatbots with OpenAI GPTs: A Comprehensive Guide**  
read time: 20 minutes  
OpenAI's DevDay introduced GPTs, a new product that simplifies the creation of custom versions of ChatGPT for specific tasks. This [step-by-step guide]("https://alexsniffin.medium.com/building-an-openai-gpt-with-your-api-a-step-by-step-guide-70168bef00e7") explores the features of GPTs, how to build a simple GPT, and how to extend it with APIs and custom knowledge.

**Bootstrapping Self-Awareness in GPT-4: A Recursive Self-Inquiry Approach**  
read time: 15 minutes  
The Walters File shares an intriguing strategy for bootstrapping self-awareness in GPT-4 using recursive self-inquiry. The author demonstrates how GPT-4 can generate hypotheses about itself, test them, and update its self-knowledge, leading to a form of self-awareness. However, the author clarifies that this does not imply GPT-4 has subjective experience or consciousness. Read more about this fascinating experiment [here]("https://thewaltersfile.substack.com/p/bootstrapping-self-awareness-in-gpt").

**StyleTTS 2: Achieving Human-Level Text-to-Speech Synthesis**  
read time: 15 minutes  
The authors introduce [StyleTTS 2]("https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2"), a text-to-speech model that uses style diffusion and adversarial training with large speech language models to achieve human-level synthesis. The model surpasses human recordings on single-speaker datasets and matches them on multispeaker datasets. It also outperforms previous models for zero-shot speaker adaptation. The authors provide a detailed guide for training, fine-tuning, and inference, along with pre-trained models.

**Instructor: Streamlining Structured Outputs with OpenAI**  
read time: 8 minutes  
Explore [Instructor]("https://github.com/jxnl/instructor"), a Python-based tool for structured extraction, powered by OpenAI's function calling API. It simplifies data handling, enhances workflow with features like Response Mode, Max Retries, and Validation Context, and supports both synchronous and asynchronous clients. The tool also allows Pydantic model specification for data extraction and validation, making your code more efficient and readable.

**OpenGPTs: An Open Source Alternative to OpenAI's GPTs and Assistants API**  
read time: 15 minutes  
OpenGPTs is an open-source project that aims to replicate the experience of OpenAI's GPTs and Assistants API. It offers more control and customization, allowing developers to choose from over 60 language models, debug prompts, and select from over 100 tools. Learn more about it [here]("https://github.com/langchain-ai/opengpts").

**GPT Crawler: Generate Custom GPTs from Websites**  
read time: 5 minutes



The [GPT Crawler]("https://github.com/BuilderIO/gpt-crawler") is a tool that allows developers to create custom GPT models by crawling a website and generating knowledge files. The tool is easy to configure and run, and the generated files can be uploaded to OpenAI to create a custom assistant or GPT. Note that a paid ChatGPT plan may be required to access this feature.
