**Building Your First LLM App: A Comprehensive Guide**



read time: 15 minutes  
This [article]("https://github.blog/2023-10-30-the-architecture-of-todays-llm-applications/") provides a detailed guide on building your first Large Language Model (LLM) application. It covers the steps to build an LLM app, the emerging architecture of today's LLM apps, and potential problem areas to explore. The article also discusses the use of LLMs in software development, including the use of pre-trained models, customization techniques, and the importance of online evaluations.

**Boosting Retrieval Augmented Generation: Choosing the Best Embedding & Reranker Models**  
read time: 15 minutes  
This [blog post]("https://blog.llamaindex.ai/boosting-rag-picking-the-best-embedding-reranker-models-42d079022e83") explores how to optimize Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines by selecting the best combination of embedding and reranker models. The authors use the Retrieval Evaluation module from LlamaIndex and metrics like Hit Rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to evaluate performance. The results highlight the effectiveness of OpenAI and JinaAI-Base embeddings when paired with CohereRerank/bge-reranker-large rerankers.

**Optimizing RAG Systems with Small-to-Big Retrieval Techniques**  
read time: 15 minutes  
Sophia Yang explores advanced techniques to optimize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in her [blog post]("https://towardsdatascience.com/advanced-rag-01-small-to-big-retrieval-172181b396d4"). She introduces the concept of small-to-big retrieval, where smaller text chunks are used for retrieval and larger chunks for synthesis. Two primary techniques, 'Child-Parent RecursiveRetriever' and 'Sentence Window Retrieval', are discussed in detail with implementation examples using LlamaIndex.

**xAIâ€™s first LLM Offering: Grok**  
read time: 15 minutes  
Elon Musk's latest company, xAI, has announced a new AI model named Grok. [Grok]("https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-announces-grok-a-rebellious-ai-without-guardrails/"), built on a language model with 33 billion parameters, is designed to answer questions with wit and handle 'spicy' questions that other AI systems reject. The model's development raises concerns about the lack of guardrails that prevent AI from generating inappropriate or harmful content. xAI is also reportedly working on a coding tool using Grok.

**Turku University and SiloGen's Initiative for World's Largest Open Source LLM**  
read time: 10 minutes  
The University of Turku and Silo AI's LLM arm, SiloGen, have announced a consortium to develop the world's largest open source Large Language Model (LLM). The initiative aims to democratise access to LLMs and ensure European digital sovereignty. The consortium will leverage resources including a world-class LLM team, data resources covering all European languages, and access to the LUMI supercomputer.
