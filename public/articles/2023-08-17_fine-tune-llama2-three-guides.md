**Leveraging Embeddings to Analyze Writing Styles**  
Read Time: 7 minutes  
In this article, [the author]("https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/yay-embeddings-math") explores how NLP embeddings can be used to build creative writing analysis tools. Specifically, they propose using embeddings to quantify abstractness, sentiment, and other styles on a continuous scale. By averaging the embeddings of example words for each "extreme", any new text's average embedding can be mapped to a score on that scale. This approach is more interpretable and customizable than traditional NLP models, while being far cheaper than custom models.

Cost and latency implications of different design decisions are explored, with helpful benchmark data. Later sections dive into task composability using control flows as well as promising multi-step use cases. Throughout, the article provides a wealth of practical advice for software developers looking to leverage the power of LLMs in their applications while maintaining reliability and efficiency. This comprehensive guide is a must-read for anyone seeking to build robust LLM-powered tools.

**The Evolution of Powerful Open-Source Language Models**  
Read Time: 20 minutes



[This comprehensive overview]("https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/the-history-of-open-source-llms-early") traces the development of popular open-source LLMs such as LLaMA, MPT, Falcon, and LLaMA-2. These models improved significantly upon early open-source LLMs by pre-training on vastly larger, higher-quality datasets containing over 1 trillion tokens of text. As a result, they match or surpass the performance of proprietary models on standard benchmarks while enabling open-source research. The article explores how these models catalyzed growth in open-source LLM applications by providing powerful base models to the community at minimal cost compared to pre-training from scratch. These developments have helped narrow the capability gap between open and closed-source language models.
