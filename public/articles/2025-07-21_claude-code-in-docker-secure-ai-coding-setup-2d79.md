### **Build Multi-Agent Research Systems with Gemini**

Estimated read time: 8 min



Google's tutorial demonstrates building a [multi-agent research workflow]("https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/llama-index") using Gemini 2.5 Pro and LlamaIndex. The system features three specialized agents: ResearchAgent searches web information, WriteAgent creates reports, and ReviewAgent provides feedback. Developers can leverage built-in Google Search tools and create custom workflows for complex AI applications requiring agent collaboration.

### **Master RAG Systems with DeepLearning.AI's New Course**

Course time: 30+ hours

DeepLearning.AI launches a comprehensive course on building production-ready [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems]("https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/"). Learn to design reliable RAG architectures, implement vector databases like Weaviate, optimize retrieval strategies, and deploy real-world applications. The hands-on curriculum covers everything from basic prototypes to domain-specific chatbots, equipping developers with essential skills for grounding LLMs in private, up-to-date data sources.

### **Kiro IDE Brings Spec-Driven Development to AI Coding**

Estimated read time: 5 min



Kiro is a new AI IDE that combines "vibe coding" with production-ready development through [spec-driven development]("https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/"). It automatically generates requirements, technical designs, and implementation tasks from prompts, while event-driven hooks catch issues before deployment. Built on Code OSS with MCP support, Kiro helps developers transition AI prototypes to maintainable production systems.

### **Mistral's Voxtral Challenges Whisper for Audio AI**

Estimated read time: 6 min



Mistral released Voxtral, an open-source audio AI model that outperforms OpenAI's Whisper at half the cost. Available in 24B and 3B variants, [Voxtral handles transcription, translation, and audio Q&A]("https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/voxtral-mistral-just-killed-whisper-for-audio-ai-82b6ad3a7596") with 32k token context supporting 30-minute audio files. Developers can run it locally, use the API for $0.001/minute, or integrate voice-to-function-calling capabilities for building advanced voice agents and RAG applications.

### **LangChain's Open Deep Research Agent Architecture**

Estimated read time: 8 min



LangChain introduces an open-source deep research agent built on LangGraph that flexibly adapts research strategies. The [multi-agent architecture]("https://blog.langchain.com/open-deep-research/") uses a supervisor to delegate tasks to sub-agents, isolating context across research topics to avoid token bloat and context clash. Key lessons include using multi-agent systems only for parallelizable tasks and implementing context engineering to manage token usage effectively.

### **AWS Launches Nova Prompt Optimizer for Better AI Results**

Estimated read time: 8 min



AWS has released Nova Prompt Optimizer, a Python SDK that automatically improves prompts for Amazon Nova models. The tool combines meta-prompting with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, offering modular adapters for prompts, inference, datasets, and metrics. Developers can optimize system and user prompts together, add few-shot examples automatically, and evaluate performance across different Nova model tiers. This [prompt optimization framework]("https://github.com/aws/nova-prompt-optimizer") helps developers building RAG applications and agent systems achieve better results without manual prompt engineering.

### **Stagehand: AI-Powered Browser Automation Framework for Developers**

Estimated read time: 8 min



Stagehand is a new open-source framework that combines AI with traditional browser automation, letting developers choose when to use natural language versus code.
