**Building a RAG System with a Self-Querying Retriever in LangChain**

Read Time: 10 minutes

[This article]("https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-rag-system-with-a-self-querying-retriever-in-langchain-16b4fa23e9ad") demonstrates how to build a movie recommendation system using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach with a self-querying retriever in LangChain. The system allows users to search for movies based on natural language queries, without relying on user data. It utilizes a self-querying retriever to filter movies by metadata before performing a similarity search. The article provides an overview of the data retrieval process, uploading documents to Pinecone, creating the self-querying retriever, and building the chat model. The author also discusses the system's limitations and potential improvements.
