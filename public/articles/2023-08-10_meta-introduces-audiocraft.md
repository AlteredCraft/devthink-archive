## üß∞¬†**Tools for AI app builders**

**Introducing AudioCraft: A New Framework for Generative AI Audio**  
[Meta has released AudioCraft]("https://ai.meta.com/blog/audiocraft-musicgen-audiogen-encodec-generative-ai-audio/"), a framework that generates high-quality audio and music from text inputs. It includes three models: MusicGen, AudioGen, and EnCodec. The models are available for research purposes and to further understanding of the technology.

**MiniChain: Simplify Coding with LLMs**  
[MiniChain]("https://github.com/srush/MiniChain") is a compact library designed to streamline coding with large language models. It's built to handle the core functionality of prompt chaining without the complexity found in larger libraries.



Much of this simplification is due to its use of python function annotations

MiniChain supports multiple backends, including OpenAI, Hugging Face, and even Python itself.  
This is a great alternative to LangChain or LlamaIndex. Another simple LLM chat SDK is the aptly named - [SimpleAiChat]("https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat").

**Unofficial Claude javascript SDK**  
[Claude Unofficial API]("https://github.com/Explosion-Scratch/claude-unofficial-api") Makes Communication Simple - Updated August 5th, 2023 This lightweight JavaScript library allows software developers to easily interact with the Claude AI chatbot platform to start new conversations, send followup messages, upload files, and manage conversations. In under 40 lines of code you can be up and running.

**LanceDB: Zero-server vector database for developers**  
[LanceDB]("https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb") provides an easy way for you as a developer to save time by simplifying the databases typically needed for large vector datasets and metadata. Its ecosystem integrations with tools you likely use like Pandas, LangChain and others mean you can start using LanceDB in your projects today.

**Another High-Performance Open-Source Vector Database**  
[Epsilla]("https://www.epsilla.com/") is an open-source vector database offering scalability, high performance, and cost-effectiveness. It supports Python and REST API, and uses advanced parallel graph traversal techniques for vector indexing, providing 10x faster vector search than HNSW.

**Building search for the post-ChatGPT world**  
[Metaphor]("https://platform.metaphor.systems/blog/building-search-for-the-post-chatgpt-world") has developed a neural search engine that uses LLMs to improve internet search quality. The company has launched the Metaphor API, enabling developers to connect their LLMs to the internet for high-quality information retrieval.

**Unify LLM interaction in this SDK wrapper**  
[EasyLLM]("https://www.philschmid.de/introducing-easyllm") provides "clients" which have a similar interface to OpenAI's API. This allows you to switch between different models with just one line of code.

**Typescript LLM Framework**  
[Ax]("https://github.com/axilla-io/ax") is a comprehensive TypeScript framework for creating robust AI applications.  
The library consists of multiple modular packages that can be adopted incrementally. This provides a scalable end-to-end solution for AI development.

**Prompt Engineering Guide for Large Language Models**  
[This guide]("https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide") on GutHub provides comprehensive resources on prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs), including latest papers, techniques, and tools. It also announces a new course on the subject, taught by AI expert Elvis Saravia.

**Unleashing Generative AI with Jupyter AI**  
[Jupyter AI]("https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/") offers a powerful platform to explore generative AI models in notebooks like JupyterLab, Google Colab, and VSCode. With '%%ai magic' command, it enables interaction with providers like AI21, Anthropic, and OpenAI, and ensures compatibility with different JupyterLab versions.



AI Chat in any Jupyter notebook

**Together AI | The cloud service for developers to build with open-source AI**  
[Together AI]("https://docs.together.ai/docs") offers a platform for fine-tuning and running large AI models, including chat, language, code, and image models. It supports hyperparameter control, weight downloads, and hosts open-source models like RedPajama and LLaMA-2.

**Open source AI chat in your IDE**  
[Continue]("https://continue.dev/") is an open-source autopilot for software development. It‚Äôs a VS Code extension that brings ChatGPT to your IDE. Features include answering coding questions, editing in natural language, and generating files from scratch.

## üì∞¬†**Generative AI news and trends**

**Anthropic releases new version of Claude Instant**  
[Claude Instant 1.2]("https://www.anthropic.com/index/releasing-claude-instant-1-2"), an AI model for tasks like text analysis and summarization, has been released with improvements in coding, reasoning, and safety. It shows better performance in math and coding evaluations, and can be accessed via API.

**Nvidia and Hugging Face Partner to Offer Cloud-Based AI Training**  
[Nvidia and Hugging Face have partnered]("https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-hugging-face-to-connect-millions-of-developers-to-generative-ai-supercomputing") to offer cloud-based AI training services. The new service, called Training Cluster as a Service, will use Nvidia's DGX Cloud infrastructure to power the training of new and custom generative AI models. Hugging Face's platform of over 250,000 models and 50,000 datasets will also be integrated into the service, providing a helpful starting point for any AI project. The collaboration makes sense for both companies, as Nvidia is looking to expand its cloud services business and Hugging Face is looking to make its platform more accessible to businesses.

**Embracing AI in Programming: A Shift, Not an End**  
[read: 5min]  
[From O‚ÄôReilly Radar]("https://www.oreilly.com/radar/fearing-the-wrong-thing/"): AI tools like GitHub's Copilot won't replace programmers but will change the discipline, making coding more efficient and freeing up time for understanding user needs, designing, testing, and debugging. This shift towards AI-assisted programming is an opportunity for developers to focus on problem-solving and customer collaboration.

**Key Patterns for Building Systems with LLMs**  
[read: 45min]  
[This post summarizes]("https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/") some of the most important patterns for integrating LLMs into systems and products, as discussed in Eugene Yan's write-up on the topic. Yan distills learnings from academic research and industry experience into seven main patterns, organized from improving performance to reducing costs and risks, and from closer to the data to closer to the user experience.
