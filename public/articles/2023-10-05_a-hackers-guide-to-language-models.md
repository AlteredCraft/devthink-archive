**NExT-GPT: A Leap Forward in Multimodal AI**  
read time: 10 minutes



Researchers have developed [NExT-GPT]("https://next-gpt.github.io/"), an end-to-end general-purpose multimodal Large Language Model (MM-LLM) system. It can perceive and generate content in text, images, videos, and audio, overcoming the limitation of input-side multimodal understanding. The system uses a small amount of parameter tuning, making it cost-effective and expandable to more modalities.

**Open Interpreter: A Local Alternative to OpenAI's Code Interpreter**  
read time: 10 minutes



Open Interpreter is an open-source tool that allows Large Language Models to run code locally on your computer. It overcomes the limitations of OpenAI's hosted, closed-source Code Interpreter by providing unrestricted internet access, no file size or runtime limits, and the ability to utilize any package or library. Learn more about it [here]("https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter").

**Introducing Marvin: A Framework for Trustworthy AI Engineering**  
read time: 5 minutes  
Marvin is a new AI engineering framework designed to make generative AI more reliable and scalable. It brings best practices from software development to AI, offering components for structuring text, classification, complex business logic, and interactive applications. Marvin aims to deliver Ambient AI, making unstructured data accessible to traditional software. Learn more about [Marvin here]("https://www.askmarvin.ai/welcome/what_is_marvin/").

**Introducing DSPy: A New Framework for Advanced Tasks with Language Models**  
read time: 15 minutes  
DSPy is a new framework that unifies techniques for prompting and fine-tuning language models, and introduces an automatic compiler that teaches language models how to conduct the declarative steps in your program. It allows for the creation of composable and declarative modules for instructing language models in a Pythonic syntax. Check out the [full details here]("https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy").

**Unstructured: Open-Source Pre-Processing Tools for Unstructured Data**  
read time: 15 minutes  
The [unstructured library]("https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured") offers open-source components for ingesting and pre-processing unstructured data like images and text documents. It also introduces a new Unstructured API and a beta feature, the Chipper model, for processing complex documents.
