### **How to Build an AI Agent With Semantic Router and LLM Tools**

Read time: 10 minutes



This tutorial demonstrates how to build an AI agent that intelligently routes user queries to the appropriate LLM-basedÂ function,Â such as retrieving real-time flight data or querying a vector database for baggage policy information.Â TheÂ agent leverages a Semantic Router to dynamically choose the best retrieval method,Â combining OpenAI's LLMs andÂ structured data to provide accurate and responsiveÂ assistance.Â [Read the full article]("https://thenewstack.io/how-to-build-an-ai-agent-with-semantic-router-and-llm-tools/")Â to learn how to implement this AI agent architecture in your own applications.

### **Cross Capabilities of Large Language Models**

Read time: 10 minutes



This article explores theÂ ["cross capabilities" of LLMs]("https://www.llm-cross-capabilities.org/")Â -Â their ability toÂ integrate multiple skills like reasoning,Â coding,Â and tool use to tackle complex,Â real-worldÂ tasks.Â The researchers introduce a comprehensive benchmark,Â CrossEval,Â to assess these cross capabilities,Â revealingÂ that LLMs often underperform on tasks requiring multiple skills due to a "Law of the Weakest Link" effect.Â The findingsÂ provide valuable insights for software developers seeking to leverage LLMs in their applications.
