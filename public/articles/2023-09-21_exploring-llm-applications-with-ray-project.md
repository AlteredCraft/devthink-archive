## 🧰 **TOOLS**

**Web AI: Deep Learning in Your Browser**  
read time: 3  
[Web AI]("https://github.com/visheratin/web-ai") is a TypeScript library enabling deep learning models to run directly in the web browser or Node.js. It simplifies AI integration into web applications, eliminating the need for complex server-side infrastructure or third-party APIs.

**Vanna: Open-Sourcing AI-Powered SQL Generation**  
read time: 8 minutes  
[Vanna]("https://vanna.ai/blog/vanna-open-source.html"), an AI-powered SQL generation tool, is now open-source. It offers high accuracy rates, custom training, and security. The open-source version allows local deployment, customization, and aims to establish a standard for AI-generated SQL. Users can contribute via Github to enhance the tool.

**ExLlamaV2: A New Inference Library for Local LLMs**  
read time: 15 minutes  
[ExLlamaV2]("https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2") is a new inference library for running local LLMs on modern consumer GPUs. It's faster and more versatile than its predecessor, with support for a new quant format. The library is still in its early stages and requires further testing and tuning.

**Brainglue: A Playground for Creative Prompt Chaining**  
read time: 3  
[Brainglue]("https://www.brainglue.ai/") is an AI playground for crafting and implementing prompt chains, enhancing AI reasoning. It offers a user-friendly interface, a template gallery, and an easy-to-integrate API, making the transition from experimentation to real-world applications seamless.
