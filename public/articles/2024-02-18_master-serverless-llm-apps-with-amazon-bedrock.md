### Maximizing Generative AI with Customized LLMs

read time: 10 minutes



This [article]("https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/3-ways-customize-llm-why-you-should-github-1hpyc") explores the importance of customizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative AI coding tools. It discusses three methods: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), In-context learning, and Fine-tuning. The article emphasizes the benefits of these methods in improving coding efficiency, information discovery, and collaboration between technical and non-technical teams.

### Evaluating RAG Metrics Across Different Retrieval Methods

read time: 8 minutes  
This article explores the evaluation of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) metrics across different retrieval methods. It discusses the performance of basic, Parent Document, and Ensemble retrievers in terms of context precision, faithfulness, answer relevancy, context recall, context relevancy, answer correctness, and answer similarity. The Ensemble Retriever, which combines sparse and dense retrievers, shows a balanced performance across multiple metrics, making it a robust choice for RAG applications.

### Overcoming Challenges in Building Data-Driven Chat Applications with LLMs

read time: 15 minutes  
Arcus discusses the challenges in building Large Language Model (LLM) chat applications that answer questions about proprietary data. They propose a solution that involves grounding LLMs on relevant data and using intelligent query transformations. This approach improves retrieval performance and LLM response accuracy.
