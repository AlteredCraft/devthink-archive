## üîé Focus on: What is Hugging Face ü§ó

*Hugging Face has done for Machine learning and Generative AI what GitHub did for git source control; 10X‚Äôd the discoverability and usability of their given domains*

HuggingFace has emerged as a leader in the Machine Learning (ML) domains including Generative AI, offering a range of services and tools that facilitate the development and deployment of ML models. Hugging Face makes it easy to share tools, models, model weights, and datasets between other practitioners. The company is driven by the principles of open-source and collaboration, making it a go-to platform for ML enthusiasts and professionals.

At the center of Hugging Face is what is referred to as the Hub. As of July/2023, the Hugging Face Hub hosts more than;

- 120,000 **models**
- 20,000 **datasets**
- 50,000 demonstration applications (**spaces**)

All of which are open source and freely accessible. This online environment encourages seamless collaboration and collective ML development. In the hub anyone can delve into, experiment with, team up and craft technology using ML.

### Models

Within Hugging Face the [Model Hub]("https://huggingface.co/models") is a repository of community contributed pre-trained models over a variety of ML tasks including NLP, computer vision, and audio. The Hub makes it easy to find and use models for a variety of tasks, such as text classification, question answering, and summarization.

Each model displays a very informative model card, giving you all the needed metadata about the model and even allowing you to interact with the model.



The model card for stable-diffusion 2.1

One way to easily leverage these models in with the Hugging Face provided Transformers library, but there is also a [growing list]("https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-libraries") of open source integrations.



### Datasets

[Datasets]("https://huggingface.co/datasets") is a collection of community-curated and popular research datasets covering Audio, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Hugging Face has created the hub site and tools to enable ease in accessing and sharing datasets.

With the provided Hugging Face python libraries, utilizing datasets couldn‚Äôt be easier.

### Spaces

[Spaces]("https://huggingface.co/spaces") is a platform for hosting and sharing ML demo apps. They allow you to create your own ML portfolio, showcase your projects at conferences or to stakeholders, and work collaboratively with other people in the ML ecosystem.

Spaces are built on top of Streamlit and Gradio, two popular Python libraries for building ML apps. This means that you can use Spaces to create a wide variety of ML apps, from simple text classification apps to complex image recognition apps.

Spaces are also easy to use. You can create a new Space in just a few minutes, and you can deploy your app with a single click. Spaces are also free to use, so there's no risk in trying them out.

Here are some examples of Spaces that have been created by the community:

- [DALL-E mini]("https://huggingface.co/spaces/Manjushri/Dall-E-Mini")**:** A text-to-image diffusion model that can be used to create realistic images from text descriptions.
- [Bark]("https://huggingface.co/spaces/suno/bark")**:** A text to audio AI model that can generate highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio - including music, background noise and simple sound effects.
- [Open LLM Leaderboard]("https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard")**:** A leaderboard that tracks the performance of different LLM models on a variety of tasks.

These are just a few examples of the many Spaces that have been created by the community. If you are interested in creating your own Space, you can learn more on the Hugging Face website.

## Wrapping up

With Hugging Face‚Äôs focus on usability, this brief overview is really all you need to get started, but rest assured, they also have a great set of [documentation]("https://huggingface.co/docs") to help along the way.

üß∞ **Software Dev AI tools and trends**

**ChatGPT's Code Interpreter: A Comprehensive Overview**  
The new ChatGPT Code Interpreter plugin offers numerous benefits for users, particularly in the realm of data science and software development. It allows users to run Python code in a sandboxed environment, ensuring safe experimentation without affecting their computer or data. [In this article]("https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/what-ai-can-do-with-a-toolbox-getting"), Ethan Mollick covers a long list of use cases.

**ChatDB: Augmenting LLMs with Databases as Their Symbolic Memory**



LLMs with symbolic memory can perform complex reasoning tasks. This brief propose a new approach that [uses SQL databases as symbolic memory]("https://chatdatabase.github.io/").

**Unity Muse and Sentis: AI-powered tools for game developers**  
Unity has announced two new AI-powered tools for game developers: [Unity Muse and Unity Sentis]("https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/introducing-unity-muse-and-unity-sentis-ai"). Muse is an AI platform that accelerates the creation of real-time 3D applications and experiences, while Sentis allows developers to embed neural networks in their builds to enable previously unimaginable real-time experiences.
