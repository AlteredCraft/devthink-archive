### **Essential AI Content for Software Devs,** **Minus the Hype**

Hello DevThink.AI readers!

Thank you for joining us for another edition of our curated AI content for software developers. In this issue, we explore why AI is actually expanding programming jobs rather than replacing them, show you how to build your first MCP server with FastMCP, and highlight exciting tools like Zed and Void that are reshaping the coding experience. We've also included a fun piece on LegoGPT that demonstrates how AI can generate physically buildable LEGO designs from text prompts.

We hope these carefully selected resources help you navigate the AI landscape with practical, hype-free insights.

Happy reading!

## ðŸ“–Â **TUTORIALS & CASE STUDIES**

### **Building Your First MCP Server with FastMCP**

Estimated read time: 15 min

This [step-by-step tutorial]("https://youtu.be/3K39NJbp2IA") demonstrates how to build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using FastMCP and create a LangChain AI agent that leverages its tools. The video covers project setup, server implementation, and agent integration, providing developers with practical insights for building MCP-enabled AI applications.

### **Voice Agents for Production with DeepLearning.ai**

Estimated read time: 6 min

[**DeepLearning.ai's new course**]("https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-ai-voice-agents-for-production/") teaches developers how to build scalable voice agents using LLMs, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech components. The free course covers architecture design, latency optimization, and WebRTC implementation, using real-world examples like Andrew Avatar to demonstrate production-ready voice agent development.

### **LLM Agents: Core Concepts to Practical Frameworks**

Estimated read time: 23 min



Dive into [this developer's guide]("https://pub.towardsai.net/understanding-llm-agents-concepts-patterns-frameworks-8c57661f3ff1") exploring LLM-based agents, from fundamental concepts to practical frameworks like LangGraph and AutoGen. Learn how agents autonomously handle complex tasks using tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities, with insights into emerging protocols like MCP and A2A for building sophisticated AI applications.

### **Secure Function Calling for AI Agents**

Estimated read time: 25 min



[Kiran Prakash's detailed walkthrough]("https://martinfowler.com/articles/function-call-LLM.html") demonstrates how to implement secure function calling in LLM-based agents, using a shopping assistant example. The article covers essential patterns for building robust AI agents, including guardrails against prompt injection, action space restrictions, and integration with the Model Context Protocol.

### **Running Multimodal Vision Models Locally**

Estimated read time: 8 min

[This hands-on guide]("https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/10/llama-cpp-vision/") demonstrates how to use llama.cpp's newly merged vision support to run multimodal models locally. Using a compact 3.2GB model, developers can now process both text and images through a command-line interface or an OpenAI-compatible API server, making local AI development more accessible.

## ðŸ§°Â **TOOLS**

### **Gemini 2.5 Pro Enhances Frontend Development**

Estimated read time: 6 min



[Google's latest update]("https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-pro-io-improved-coding-performance/") introduces significant improvements to Gemini 2.5 Pro's coding capabilities, particularly in frontend development and UI creation. The model now ranks first in WebDev Arena benchmarks and offers enhanced video-to-code conversion. Developers can access these features through Google AI Studio or Vertex AI, maintaining the same pricing structure.

### **Zed: Rust-Based Code Editor with AI Agents**

Estimated read time: 8 min

[Zed]("https://zed.dev/blog/fastest-ai-code-editor") is a Rust-based, open-source code editor with integrated AI capabilities. The editor features an Agent Panel supporting multiple LLM providers, custom model integration, and extensive tool customization. Developers can use their own API keys or opt for Zed's pricing plans, with privacy-focused design and no data harvesting.

### **Claude Now Offers Real-Time Web Search**

Estimated read time: 6 min

[Anthropic's new web search API]("https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search-api") enables developers to build Claude-powered applications that access current web information. The feature supports RAG implementations and AI agents with real-time data, includes domain control settings, and integrates with Claude Code for enhanced development workflows. Pricing starts at $10 per 1,000 searches.

### **Void: VS Code Fork with AI Features**

Estimated read time: 3 min

[Void]("https://voideditor.com/") emerges as an open-source alternative to Cursor, built on VS Code's foundation. This Y Combinator-backed editor integrates AI coding features like intelligent autocomplete, inline editing, and multiple chat modes while allowing developers to use custom models and maintain data control. It preserves VS Code's familiar environment, supporting existing themes and settings.

### **Why AI Is Expanding Programming Jobs**

Estimated read time: 12 min

[This analysis]("https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-and-programming-the-beginning-of-a-new-era/") challenges the notion that AI will replace programmers, instead highlighting how LLMs are creating new opportunities in software development. The article explores the emergence of "vibe coding" and AI engineering, suggesting that lowered barriers to programming are expanding the field's possibilities rather than diminishing them.

### **Vector Search: From Hype to Integration**

Estimated read time: 12 min

[This industry perspective]("https://x.com/jobergum/status/1872923872007217309?s=46&utm_source=devthink.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-ai-is-expanding-programming-jobs") examines how vector databases, initially hyped as essential infrastructure for RAG applications, are being absorbed into traditional search engines and databases. The trend shows that vector search isn't a separate category but rather a crucial capability alongside conventional search features, impacting how developers approach AI application architecture.

### **LegoGPT: Generating Buildable LEGO From Text**

Estimated read time: 4 min



This was a fun one, who doesn't love Legos. [LegoGPT]("https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/") introduces a novel LLM-based approach for generating physically stable LEGO designs from text prompts. The system employs physics-aware validation during inference and includes a dataset of 47,000 LEGO structures. Developers can explore the open-source code, models, and dataset for implementing similar constraint-aware generative AI systems.
