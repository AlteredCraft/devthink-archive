Stay informed on the latest tools and trends of AI assisted software development

## General news

**Ask Questions About Your Data with PandasAI**

[PandasAI]("https://github.com/gventuri/pandas-ai") is a Python library that adds generative AI capabilities to Pandas. It allows developers to ask questions about their data and get answers back in the form of Pandas DataFrames. By using PandasAI in conjunction with Pandas, developers can perform complex queries, draw graphs, and generate conversational responses.

**AI Systems: Stay Curious, Skeptical, and Informed!**

While AI systems have potential, they can also be misused legally and illegally. The problem isn't that they're too smart, but rather that [they're flawed and sometimes overpromised]("https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2023/beware-of-ai-snake-oil/"). Many AI vendors are true believers, but let's be cautious and not fall for the "this time it's different" mantra. Instead, let's keep an eye on the research and make informed decisions. Stay curious and skeptical! üßêüí°

## Enterprise

**Microsoft to Launch Privacy-Focused ChatGPT for Sensitive Industries at a Premium Cost**

Microsoft plans to offer a [privacy-focused version of ChatGPT]("https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/report-microsoft-plans-privacy-first-chatgpt-for-businesses-with-secrets-to-keep/") to banks, healthcare providers, and large organizations concerned about data leaks and regulatory compliance. The product, expected to be announced later this quarter, will run on dedicated servers, keeping sensitive data separate and preventing inadvertent leaks. However, this private version may cost up to 10 times more than the regular ChatGPT. OpenAI is also planning a similar product, with the main difference being Microsoft's reliance on its Azure platform.

**AI and the Future Workforce: IBM's Bold Move and Its Impact on Job Prospects**

IBM is reportedly [pausing hiring for roles]("https://archive.ph/2023.05.02-160446/https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-tech-jobs-layoffs-ceos-chatgpt-ibm-2023-5") that can be performed by AI, potentially affecting 7,800 jobs. The rise of generative AI technology, like ChatGPT, has prompted tech firms such as IBM, Amazon, Dropbox, Meta, and Microsoft to make significant investments in AI to improve efficiency and reduce costs. While some argue that AI will create new jobs, others fear job losses may be permanent, as AI-driven efficiency measures slow future headcount growth and enhance the productivity of a shrinking workforce.

**Pinecone's Impressive Leap: Harnessing AI for Semantic Search and a $100 Million Boost**

Pinecone, a [vector database company]("https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/27/pinecone-drops-100m-investment-on-750m-valuation-as-vector-database-demand-grows/") focused on AI-driven semantic search, has raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, valuing it at $750 million. The growing interest in large language models (LLMs) and their potential has accelerated Pinecone's growth, with 1,500 customers including Shopify, Gong, and Zapier. The vector database can work in tandem with LLMs to improve search and flexibility. Pinecone plans to expand its workforce with the new funding.
