AI topics for software developers

*Curating the ocean of AI news keeping you informed on topics key to the craft of software development*



## Developer tools

**Buildt: The Future of Code Search**

[Buildt]("https://www.buildt.ai/") is an AI tool that helps developers quickly search, understand, and extend large codebases. This project is just getting started and was founded by three friends. Contextual search is its current killer feature, for example, "Where are request tokens validated in the backend?" Codegen and Code Explanation features are in the works.

**Codium v0.6.0 is out**

Codium comes out swinging with [release v.0.6.0]("https://www.codium.ai/blog/codiumai-v0-6-0-generate-run-fix-iterate/"). Huge investments in the unit testing workflow for developers — enabling you to to generate tests, run them, fix the tests or the application code, and iterate. See it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiURaVrMFbI&t=4s&utm_source=devthink.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=meta-open-sources-ai-tools "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiURaVrMFbI&t=4s&utm_source=devthink.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=meta-open-sources-ai-tools").

**Microsoft to Integrate GitHub Copilot with Windows Terminal**

Microsoft is [integrating its GitHub Copilot AI assistant with Windows Terminal]("https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23732464/microsoft-windows-ai-terminal-github-copilot-integration-build"). This will allow developers to use Copilot to help them write code, debug, and understand programs. Copilot is a powerful tool that can save developers time and improve their productivity. I'm excited to see how this integration will make it easier for developers to use Copilot. I found this interesting as it demonstrates the trend towards ubiquitous access to AI tools in the developer workflow, we will get to a point where we will just expect it to be in any tool we are using

## Top developer stories

**Meta Open Sources AI Tools to Help Developers Build Better Apps**

[Meta has open sourced its AI toolkit]("https://archive.ph/2023.05.18-183017/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/technology/ai-meta-open-source.html"), which includes tools for natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. The toolkit is designed to help developers build better apps by providing them with access to state-of-the-art AI models and algorithms. Meta seems to be using open-source software to help it compete with OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. The more people using Meta's tools, the greater the probability they will stay relevant in the AI space.

**Meta Builds AI Model That Can Generate Code Similar to GitHub Copilot**

Meta has built an AI model that can generate code similar to GitHub Copilot. The model, called [CodeCompose]("https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/meta-built-a-code-generating-ai-model-similar-to-copilot/"), is trained on a massive dataset of open source code. It can generate code for a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++. Meta says that CodeCompose can help developers save time and improve the quality of their code. The company is not yet releasing CodeCompose to the public, but it plans to do so in the future.

## Low/No code

**Microsoft's New Power Platform AI Features Are Empowering Developers**

Microsoft unveiled a wide range of new features for its [Power Platform]("https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-unveils-new-power-platform-features-build-2023-low-code-technologies-developers/") at its Build 2023 conference. The new features are aimed at revolutionizing app development and empowering professional and citizen developers with low-code technologies. One of the most interesting new features is the AI-powered Power Platform Copilot, which can help developers write code faster and more accurately. I'm excited to see how these new features will make it easier for developers to create powerful applications.
