## 🧰 AI tools that help you build software

**WizardCoder model takes a substantial lead in open source code related tasks**  
[Wizard Coder]("https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/tree/main/WizardCoder"), a 15 billion parameter AI model, excels in code generation, take a substantial lead in performance compared to other open source models and even 3rd place when comparing to closed models such as ChatGPT.

**Integrate ChatGPT in your IDE**  
[Bito]("https://bito.ai/") gives you a very nicely integrated Chat gpt panel in your IDE. There are nice add on features such as prompt saving in the form of *Templates*. It ships with a few and you can add your own. There is also integration to the context menu, so highlight code the select a Bito tool such as “simplify code”. Bito will make the change and show you the diff

**AI-Powered Web Accessibility**  
[UserWay's Fix My Code]("https://userway.org/fixmycode") is an AI-powered tool that can optimize your code to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. It can create (or fix your pasted) login forms, popups, and nav menus.

**Generate an entire codebase from chat**  
[gpt]("https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer")-[engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer"https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer") enables you to specify what you want it to build, and the AI asks for clarification, and then builds it. The configuration options and clarification work stream sets this open source product apart from other tools making similar claims. [Lots of folks](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22gpt-engineer%22&utm_source=devthink.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gpt-engineer-generate-an-entire-codebase-from-chat "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22gpt-engineer%22&utm_source=devthink.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gpt-engineer-generate-an-entire-codebase-from-chat") are excited about this one.

## 🏗️ Utilizing AI in your software

**Vercel Launches AI SDK for React and Svelte**  
[Vercel has introduced an AI SDK]("https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-the-vercel-ai-sdk") for building AI-powered applications. It helps developers build conversational, streaming, and chat user interfaces in JavaScript and TypeScript. The SDK supports React/Next.js, Svelte/SvelteKit, with support for Nuxt/Vue coming soon.

**Run LLM apps on iphone, android and more**  
[MLC LLM]("https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm") is a universal solution that allows any language model to be deployed natively on diverse hardware backends and native applications. It offers a customizable workflow for developers to implement models and optimizations

**Open Platform for Operating Large Language Models**  
[OpenLLM]("https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM") is an open platform for operating large language models (LLMs) in production. It allows you to fine-tune, serve, deploy, and monitor any LLMs with ease.

## 📰 AI news for devs

**92% of programmers are using AI tools**  
According to a new [GitHub programmer survey]("https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-developer-survey-finds-92-of-programmers-using-ai-tools/"), 92% of US-based developers are already using AI coding tools both in and outside of work. Developers say AI coding tools help them meet existing performance standards with improved code quality, faster outputs, and fewer production-level incidents.

**Stack Overflow enters the AI arena**  
[Stack Overflow]("https://stackoverflow.co/labs/") which has to date been the source for many training models has announced how they will start to embrace AI to better their own product. This includes features such as Question Formatting Assistant, Chat Decipher—use AI to extract questions from chat transcripts such as Slack and group together ones that are similar or duplicates, and Title Suggestions—Using AI during the question writing process to help generate more descriptive, accurate titles.

**An Open Reproduction of LLaMA lands on Hugging Face** 🤗  
Meta AI’s LLaMA is not licensed for commercial use, [OpenLLaMA]("https://huggingface.co/openlm-research/open_llama_13b_easylm") is a permissively licensed open source reproduction. They are releasing 3B, 7B, and 13B models trained on 1T tokens. Thus if you've been doing research work with LLaMA, you can switch to OpenLLaMA for utilization in commercial products.

**The Double-Edged Sword of AI-Coded Software**  
[AI is making coding more efficient but could lead to complications like increasing technical debt and code complexity]("https://archive.ph/2023.05.31-215650/https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ai-is-writing-code-now-for-companies-that-is-good-and-bad-6f19ecdc"). The surge in AI-written code raises concerns about manageability, but the efficiency gains and response to a talent shortage can't be overlooked. Still, adopting AI tools like GitHub's Copilot or Magic AI means we need to rethink our methodologies to ensure quality over quantity. What struck me is how AI is changing the very dynamics of software development.

**GPT Can Use Tools Now—That’s a Big Deal**  
This is an entertaining discusses of the [recent update to GPT called “function calling”]("https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-4-can-use-tools-now-that-s-a-big-deal") which allows it to call out to external code, databases, or other APIs when it needs to. Each function in function calling represents a tool that a GPT model can use when necessary, and GPT gets to decide which ones it wants to use and when.

**Can you trust ChatGPT’s package recommendations?**  
This article discusses the research done by Vulcan Cyber, which discovered that attackers can [use ChatGPT to help them spread malicious packages]("https://vulcan.io/blog/ai-hallucinations-package-risk/") into developers’ environments. The technique relies on the fact that ChatGPT sometimes answers questions with hallucinated sources, links, blogs, and statistics.
